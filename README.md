# Entertainment Web App

Welcome to the Entertainment Web App, a platform that allows users to explore and interact with movies. With this app, users can log in, sign up, reset forgotten passwords, bookmark movies, and access detailed information about their favorite films.

2. Install the necessary dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the app.
